# Developer Portfolio – cheovermeyer.com

This is the source code for my personal developer portfolio, built as a single-page React app. It serves as a showcase for my projects, skills, and experience as a full-stack developer with a focus on the Next.js and React/Django stacks.

## ✦ Features

- **React Router** for seamless client-side navigation
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions
- **react-swipeable** for mobile-friendly swipe interactions
- Clean, responsive layout for both desktop and mobile users
- Modular component-based structure for easy maintenance and scalability

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cheplusplus/portfolio
